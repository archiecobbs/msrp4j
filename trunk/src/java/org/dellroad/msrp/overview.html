<p>
This is the API documentation for version @VERSION@ of the <a href="http://msrp4j.googlecode.com/"><b>msrp4j</b></a>
Java library.
</p>

<b>msrp4j</b> is a Java library for the MSRP protocol defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4975">RFC 4975</a>.
MSRP is a TCP protocol for transmitting messages containing arbitrary content between peers. MSRP can be thought of as a
TCP/IP version of SMS/MMS text messaging.

<b>msrp4j</b> implements the actual MSRP protocol itself. The setup and/or negotiation of MSRP sessions must be handled
by other means; this is typically done via SIP.

<p>
The central Java class is {@link org.dellroad.msrp.Msrp}; each instance represents an MSRP protocol stack.
